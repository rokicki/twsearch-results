Notes on the UFO:

It's difficult on my UFOs to make horizontal turns (those that preserve
the top and bottom) but easy to make vertical turns (where you mix the
top and bottom).  So I've been interested in solutions that minimize
the number of horizontal twists.

God's number for the UFO is well known (14 moves HTM, 16 moves QTM).
But if vertical turns are free, what's the minimum number of horizontal
turns?

If you really don't want to spin, here are counts.

No spin:           96
With spin:        396
No spin:        23520
With spin:      90300
No spin:      4509024
With spin:   15067689
No spin:    342841344
With spin:  456788554
No spin:    479001600

So you can solve every UFO position with just four horizontal spins.

Let's check things out then with quarter-turns, so now we only allow
60 degree spins, and see what happens.

No spin:           96
With spin:        216
No spin:        11616
With spin:      24780
No spin:        11616
With spin:      24780
No spin:      1133664
With spin:    2308282
No spin:     76991136
With spin:  134249961
No spin:    478382016
With spin:  478811552
No spin:    479001600

So all positions can be solved with at most six 60-degree spins.

What's the easiest way to solve it?  Frankly, all you need is one
move.  First, solve the top half (this is easy).  Next, flip over the
puzzle.  This algorithm swaps the north and northeast piece with
only two easy U spins.

It looks long but it's easy to remember and execute, and you don't
need to execute this more than a few times.
